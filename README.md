This course represents half of [Advanced Topics in Machine Learning](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/current_students/syllabus/compgi/compgi13_advanced_topics_in_machine_learning/) (aka COMP GI13 / COMP M050) from the [UCL CS MSc on Machine Learning](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_machine_learning/). 

The other half is [Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in Machine Learning](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/rkhscourse.html) (Taught by Prof. [Arthur Gretton](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/)).

Course announcements will be posted on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/csml-advanced-topics).

## Course Description

Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) studies the problem of learning from empirical observations (data) to predict and/or understand the behavior of an unknown phenomenon (e.g. the dynamics of the stock market or the activations patterns in the human brain). SLT provides a mathematical framework within which it is
possible rigorously address questions such as "How to design a learning algorithm", "what does it mean for an algorithm to 'solve' a learning problem" or "How to compare two learning algorithms".  

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the ideas behind most well-established learning algorithms and provide fundamental insights on how to use them in practice or to design new ones. 


## Prerequisites

Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Calculus.

## Grading

Final grades will depend on *two* project assignment (50%) and a final exam (50%).
